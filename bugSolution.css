The solution is to set the width of the parent container. Here's the corrected CSS:

```css
.parent {
  width: 100%; /* or a specific width */
}
div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
  box-sizing: border-box; /*optional, for better control of width including padding and border*/
}
```

By setting the parent's width, we guarantee that the divs will be able to use 50% of that width correctly, resulting in the expected horizontal layout.
