The following CSS code causes unexpected behavior in some browsers:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}
```

This code intends to make two divs occupy 50% of the width each and sit side-by-side. However, if the parent container does not have its width explicitly set, it will collapse to the width of the divs, causing the divs to stack vertically instead of horizontally.
